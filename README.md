# Learning Python

Here I am going to discuss some design issues with Py and elaborate on the basics using code and their output.

**Primitive Data Types**

Primitive Data Types are the components that make or break a function. There are different kind of data types:

**Character String Types**

Using Py, we can do various operations using String (as there is no char data type in Py). Such as finding out it's length and concatenate.

**Enumeration**
Enumeration is a module we import in Py to bind unique values to different names/string. Almost like putting dates of calendar on weekdays.
There are some design issues using enum:
>Enum members are immutable once defined
>Enums are classes, which means accessing enum members can be slower compared to using simple constants or integers.
>Python's enums do not support multiple inheritance.
>Enum members are designed to be compared by identity, not by value.

**Array Types**
Array is a data storing module that let's us store multiple values in one variable. **Array is not the same as List** (**We mainly use list in Py**)
But there are some issues:
>Array module provides limited functionality for data manipulation. Simply result=Arr1+Arr2 is not possible.
>Array lacks many useful built-in methods for operations like sorting, reversing, or counting elements.

**Record Types**
Record types are data structures used to store fields or attributes in a structured manner.
Issues:
>Some record types (e.g., named tuples) are immutable by design, while others (e.g., data classes) are mutable by default.
>While dataclass and named tuples reduce boilerplate compared to regular classes, they still require some boilerplate to define attributes.
>May require custom serialization logic.

**Union Types**
Union types are used to store multiple types of data in one variable.
Issues:
>Allowing multiple types for a single variable can lead to ambiguity and complexity, making it harder to understand or predict how the code behaves.
>Union types can be misused to cover too many types, leading to poor design practices or "catch-all" type hints.

**Pointers**
Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. I have used C++ for this example.
Issues:
>A dangling pointer occurs when a pointer still refers to a memory location that has been deallocated or goes out of scope.
>Dereferencing a null pointer (a pointer that doesnâ€™t point to a valid memory location) leads to crashes or undefined behavior.
>Pointers are a common source of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and memory corruption.
>Double free occurs when memory is freed more than once, which can corrupt the memory management system.
